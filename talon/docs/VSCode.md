# Developing LWC locally

## VSCode

Welcome to a new world. A world where you may choose any editor your heart desires! Here are a few I can recommend:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) :raised_hands:***Recommended***:raised_hands:
  - Debug configuration already setup!
  - Commit Signing through GUI!
  - Check out [LWC-VSCode](https://git.soma.salesforce.com/lwc/lwc-vscode) for an awesome plugin!
- [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
- [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/)
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- Vim... you get the idea. Any editor you want!

## Use a lightweight editor

I so highly recommend using a lightweight editor instead of Eclipse or IntelliJ that I created this section just to convince you to do it. Seriously there isn't any important content here, and you could skip this whole section and completely pass with a golden star. 

Not only does Eclipse offer an overly complex solution to designing rather straightforward code, but VSCode and others offer you so many incredible open-source plugins that will significantly improve your productivity and relative happiness. 

And to emphasize how ridiculous it would be to not follow my instruction of downloading one of those editors, I went as far as researching a proper idiom for this very argument.

> You wouldn't use a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

Thank you. I rest my case.
