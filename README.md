## Core Commerce SDK Modules and SFRA Modules

We are working on The Salesforce Commerce Cloud Storefront Reference Architecture with Lightning Web Components.

- `sfcc` mono-repo: The runtime core shared code (non-storefront specific).
- `sfra`: mono-repo: The runtime storefront extensions and services and storefront BFFs.

Modules are published as `@sfcc-dev/[module]` at `https://npm.lwcjs.org`
