# Best Practices

## This Ain't Aura

When starting to build a Raptor component, one might be tempted to simply copy and paste a majority of code from the previous Aura component. Don't do that. Seriously stop it. Here are just a few reasons why you might not want to do that:
- Most code is no longer needed. The Raptor component has it's own logic that will eradicate most of the code in your Aura component.
- Make it better this time. Your old Aura component was probably written a long time ago and likely doesn't utilize the newest features of Salesforce.

Please reference [this Quip doc](https://salesforce.quip.com/2vxjAaTjclqT) for more Best Practices. We will slowly be moving that information into Markdown files like this.
