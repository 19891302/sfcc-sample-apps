    Communities Lightning Web Framework :sunglasses:

    The goal of a Raptor Only Runtime, known here as Talon, is to provide a **fast**, standards-based LWC application framework. This web framework will allow any Salesforce team or cloud to support true **B2C experience** with a lightweight development environment to enhance **developer productivity**. 

    The framework will be built with the following principles in mind: 
    
    - Performance
    - Standards-Based
    - Adhere to the [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) / [PRPL Pattern](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/) principles
    - Scalability
    - LWC as a first-class citizen
    - Off Core development
