# Configure Local Repo

## Yarn

We use `yarn` as our package mangager. This tool pulls in all the packages and dependencies we need to run our app. 

Check if you have yarn with...

```bash
which yarn
```

If you don't have yarn, please reference [the Yarn site](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for your OS specific download 

### Install

Now you'll need to pull in the dependencies for our application. Use the following command:

```bash
yarn install 
```
