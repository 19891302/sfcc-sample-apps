# SFRA Next Spike

We are working on The Salesforce Commerce Cloud Storefront Reference Architecture with Lightning Web Components.

- `sfcc` mono-repo: The runtime core shared code (non-storefront specific).
- `sfra`: mono-repo: The runtime storefront extensions and services and storefront BFFs.
- `sfra-app`: The reference app based on `Talon` which imports the `@sfcc/core` and `@sfra/[modules]`.
